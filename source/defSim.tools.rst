Tools
=======================

The tools module contains a number of useful, but not necessarily related methods. The CreateOutputTable class is
called at the end of a simulation run, to generate the pandas data frame used to summarize the run.
OutputMeasures contains the methods used to generate certain statistics about the run (reported tickwise or calculated
only at the end of a run. The Plots module contains a number of matplotlib and seaborn based plots that are tailored
to the output typically generated by defSim. The NetworkDistanceUpdater is used at every timestep to calculate the
distance between agents based on their similarities and differences on their features.
Finally, ClusterExecutionScript contains the script called when the parallel option of the Experiment.run method is
set to True.
