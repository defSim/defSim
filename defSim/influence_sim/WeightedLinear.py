class WeightedLinear(InfluenceOperator):
    """
    The weighted linear influence function implements the experienced opinion shift as a function of the
    pre-interaction cultural or opinional distance between the agents involved. The ``homophily`` parameter controls
    the steepness of the attraction/repulsion curve. Formally:

    .. math:: o_{i,t+1} = o_{i,t} + \\textrm{convergence_rate} \\cdot (1 - \\textrm{homophily} | o_{j} - o_{it} |)

    Thereafter, opinions are bounded such that they never fall outside the range :math:`[0,1]`

    Crucial is the homophily parameter. The higher its value, the smaller the shift of the receiving
    agent in the direction of the sending agent will be. With this parameter, we can integrate ideas of positive,
    moderated positive, and negative influence into one functional model.

    Three critical values for the ``homophily`` parameter:

    * homophily == 0: only positive influence, the agents exhibit no preference for like-minded others.
    * homophily > 0: moderated positive influence, the agents exhibit a preference for like-minded others and move
      less towards the sender as their distance increases.
    * homophily > 1: moderated postive influence AND negative influence, the agents exhibit a preference for
      like-minded others and move less towards the sender as their distance increases, until distance
      :math:`1 / \\textrm{homophily}` where agents experience a push away from the sending agent.

              In 'one-to-one' the focal agent influences one other agent, in 'one-to-many' multiple other

            position the receiving agent will adopt. E.g. when set to 1, the receiving agent assimilates - adopting the
            sending agent's position fully, but when set to 0.5, the receiving agent moves only half-way towards the
            sending agent's position. Passed as a kwargs argument.
        :param float=0 homophily: A number :math:`\geq` 0 that controls the shape of the influence curve. At 0, agents
            do not show a preference for similar others (only positive influence). At 1, agents more strongly adjust
            their opinion when confronted with similar others (moderated positive influence). At values > 1, there
            exists a point at which influence becomes negative, making agents shift away from the sending agents
